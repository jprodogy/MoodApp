I’m glad you’re okay,Good job,Excellent,Enjoy your day
It will be okay,Better days are coming,Be strong for yourself and others,You are too amazing to be feeling this way,I hope you get better,Life is too short to be feeling this way,I’m sorry you are feeling this way, That’s unfortunate
Calm down,Think about how you are making other feel,You are better than this,Look over it and put it in the past, Stay leveled headed,Whatever you are mad about is not worth it,Humble thyself before being humbled by someone else
Keep on going,You don't get tired,Work harder than the people around you
You are smart to feel this way,You will figure it out,What have you not overcome in the past,Confusion happens to everyone, A confused person is someone ready to learn
You can do it,A calm mind is best the mind
Tough days do not last but tough people do, You are the best and do not let anyone tell you different, You are amazing, You have amazing people around you to help you through this 
Calm down,You’ll figure it out, Do your best,The best is all you can do, You are the greatest,You have done harder things
Keep on working, That is great, Stay focused, You are a cool person, Being humble is the best action you can do
