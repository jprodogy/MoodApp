"Treat yourself,Hangout with friends,Get some hard work done,Get something nice for the people in your life"
"Take a nap,Watch your favorite show, Be with your family,Ask yourself 'is it worth you being sad?'"
"Take deep breaths for 3 mins,Go to the gym and release that anger on the weights,Punch your pillow"
"Meditate,Go for a run"
"Meditate,Take a nap, Ask for help,Search the problem on the web"
"Stretch,Take a nap if you can,Drink some coffee,listen to music"
"Take a break,Eat something,Ride a bike,Listen to relaxing music,Use a stress ball"
"Focus on the good in your life,Make a list of what you're grateful for,Listen to uplifting music,Hang with friends or family,Think about a fun upcoming event in your life"
"Try to mingle with others,Go outside and relax"
